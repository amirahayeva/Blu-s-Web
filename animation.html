		<h1>A Sense of Blu</h1>
		<p>Blu has big eyes and light pink (slightly purple) irises. She has a calm confidence, is known by those she is close with, and is observed, at times, by other residents. She helps around the village and spreads positivity through her dances that she performs with others at the village events.</p>
