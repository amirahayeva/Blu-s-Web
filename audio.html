		<h1>What Does Snow Valley Sound Like?</h1>
		<p>Snow Valley sounds whimsical and fairy-like. However, during events it can get very [positively] rowdy and upbeat. Blu lives with the other villagers/residents in this not-too-big/not-too-small valley. The indefinite blue snow does not change the temperature; when it is hot, it is hot, when it is cold, it is cold. Light and calming wind can always be heard even if it does not result in a breeze.</p>
